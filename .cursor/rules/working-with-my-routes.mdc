# Your rule content

- This is Nextjs app router
- When nesting routes that require mutliple slugs, use this convetion /api/event/[id]/tickets/[ticketId], where the first slug will be named id for the resource, and following id will be more specific
- always use async parms in my api routs and awit them like this " export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
  ) {
  try {
  const { id } = await params;
  const { workspaceId } = await getAuthSession(); "
